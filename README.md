# Super Zombie Fortress [![Action Status](https://github.com/redsunservers/SuperZombieFortress/workflows/Package/badge.svg)](https://github.com/redsunservers/SuperZombieFortress/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)

Custom Team Fortress 2 Gamemode, inspired by Left 4 Dead.

There's 2 teams, Survivors (RED) and Zombies (BLU). The Survivors start with melee weapons and must survive for x amount of time while collecting weapons/ammo that are found around the map.

The Zombie team starts off with a percent of the total amount of players, and must kill and infect the survivors before x amount of time runs out. To counteract the imbalance between melee-only and the ranged weapons that the survivors have, zombies can also "mutate" into special infected. On every kill, the zombie gains a special infected point, which is factored into spawning as a special infected after death.

Plugin originally based off [MekuCube's 1.05 version](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1467101) back in 2011 for Slag Gaming, which eventually was abandoned.
[redsun.tf](https://redsun.tf/) has been updating this plugin since 2016, with many balance changes and bugfixes for 2.0 (private) and 3.0 (public) versions.
